			</h3>

			<p>
				h2zero is an easy to use object relationship mapper (ORM) for Java and MySQL.
			</p>
			<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
			<p>
				There are so many object relational mappers (ORMs) out there that do what h2zero does. 
				It isn't special, it just provides a link between your database and generates your Java 
				code to be able to use it.
			</p>

			<p>Unlike other ORMs, you have full control of the SQL that is generated. So, if you<p>

			<ul>
				<li>use MySQL</li>
				<li>use Java</li>
				<li>optionally use tomcat (JSPs/Tag Libraries/Servlets)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then this may be the ORM for you.<p>

			<p>
				Unlike other ORMs, most (not all, but most) of the SQL must be hand-crafted by 
				you, no horrible best-effort code generation, no horrific un-parseable SQL 
				statements in the logs. Just pure SQL that was hand-crafted by you to get the 
				best performance out of the database.
			</p>

			<p>
				You have complete control over the SQL statements that are executed meaning 
				that you can optimise your statements the way you want them, not the way that 
				the generator thinks you should.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Your</strong> database, just the way that <strong>you</strong> designed it.</p>
