			</h3>

			<p>
				Tables are the base object that then generates the model objects for interaction through the java code.  As 
				such  they are relatively straight-forward, the field definitions are the next important piece of the h2zero 
				generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each database schema, there must be a JSONArray keyed on {import src/imports/links/tables.templar} 
				of JSONObjects
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
"tables": [{\n}
{\t}{{{\n}
{\t}{\t}"name": "user_type",{\n}
{\t}{\t}...{\n}
{\t}},{\n}
{\t}{{{\n}
{\t}{\t}"name": "user",{\n}
{\t}{\t}...{\n}
{\t}},{\n}
]{\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				Each table <strong>MUST</strong> have a key of <code>name</code> which 
				will map to the database schema and model object in CamelCase naming 
				conventions.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example the <code>user_type</code> table name above will generate the 
				following model object
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>
					The <code>user_type</code> table is a <u>Constant Model</u> and differs 
					from normal other models in that constant tables cannot be updated, deleted 
					or inserted into as they are pre-generated by h2zero.
				</em>
			</p>

			{set tableUserTypeCodeLink as code}
			{import src/imports/links/link-to-code.templar}

			<p>
				The <code>user</code> table name above will generate the 
				following model object
			</p>

			{set tableUserCodeLink as code}
			{import src/imports/links/link-to-code.templar}

			<p>
				<em>
					The <code>user</code> table is a <u>Regular Model</u> object that maps to the underlying MySQL table 
					and h2zero will allow generation of all create, read, update and delete (CRUD) methods.
				</em>
			</p>

			<h4>Constant Models</h4>

			<p>
				<em>See the section on {import src/imports/links/constants.templar} for more information on how to generate them.</em>
			</p>


			<h4>Regular Models</h4>

			<p>
				Regular models are the default generation for h2zero and as opposed to {import src/imports/links/constants.templar} 
				allow access to insert new rows into the database and have access to the full range of interactions.
